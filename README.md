dns-snoop
=========
Beta version:

For a domain list given, dns-snoop allows you to look for suspicious DNS request. You just need to provide a CSV file with the domains requested in your network to figure out if some of you hosts could be compromised.

If you are interested in this project don't hesitate to collaborate!!! We will be really glad!!!
